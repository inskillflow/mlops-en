# MLOps with MLflow, FastAPI & Streamlit — full course

A hands-on, **chapter-by-chapter** course that teaches MLOps by building one realistic stack:

```text
   Streamlit (UI)  ──►  FastAPI (REST API)  ──►  MLflow (tracking + registry)
            \____________________  Docker Compose  ____________________/
```

Every new chapter adds **one and only one** MLflow concept on top of the previous one. Same wine-quality dataset, same `ElasticNet` baseline, same Docker stack — only the focused MLflow call changes. That's how you build durable understanding.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you only read one section, read [§ 3 — How to navigate the course](#section-3). It explains the recommended pace, the diff-based reading habit, and the single command that runs each chapter.

## 1. Who this course is for

- Data scientists who already train models but don't yet **log, version, and serve** them properly.
- Backend / DevOps engineers who want to learn **what MLOps actually adds** to a normal web stack.
- Anyone preparing for a junior MLOps role and wanting a full, runnable portfolio repo.

Each chapter is self-contained: clone, `cd chapXX-...`, `docker compose up`, follow the lesson `.md`, tear down. No global state.

## 2. Prerequisites

| | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **OS** | Windows 10/11 (with WSL 2), macOS, or Linux. Windows PowerShell or `bash` both work. |
| **Tooling** | Docker Desktop ≥ 4.30 (Windows/macOS) **or** Docker Engine + Docker Compose v2 (Linux). |
| **Memory** | 6 GB RAM available to Docker (8 GB recommended). |
| **Disk** | ~5 GB free for images, volumes, and artifacts across all chapters. |
| **Knowledge** | Python basics, `pip`, ability to read a `Dockerfile`. No prior MLflow knowledge required. |

If you don't have Docker installed yet, **start with chapter 06** — it walks you through the full Docker Desktop install, Docker concepts, and your first `docker compose up`.

If you can't (or don't want to) use Docker, **chapter 05** shows the pure-`venv` path on Ubuntu 24 — but the rest of the course assumes Docker.

## 3. How to navigate the course

### 3.1 The 4-step ritual for every chapter

For chapter `XX`:

```bash
cd chapXX-<short-name>
docker compose up --build           # or: docker compose up -d --build
# → open the lesson side-by-side: ../XX-practical-work-...md
# → open the URLs from the chapter (MLflow on :5000, FastAPI on :8000, Streamlit on :8501)
# → run the curl commands and click around the UI
docker compose down
```

### 3.2 Read with a "diff" habit

Each chapter only changes a handful of lines. The fastest way to learn is to **diff** the previous chapter against the new one:

```bash
# from inside 00-mlops-en-english/
diff -ru chap08-... chap09-...           # Linux/macOS
# or use VS Code: "Compare Folders" extension, or any GUI diff
```

You'll instantly see the few new MLflow lines that today's chapter is teaching. The lesson `.md` highlights them in a "**The lines we add today**" section near the top.

### 3.3 Don't skip the UI tour

Every chapter ends with a "Visualize in the UI" section. Looking at MLflow's UI **after** running the code is what makes the abstract Python calls click. Five minutes of clicking around saves an hour of confusion later.

### 3.4 Don't run two chapters at once

All chapters use the same ports (5000, 8000, 8501). Always `docker compose down` the previous chapter before starting the next one — otherwise the new stack won't bind its ports.

                                                          12  loops & nested runs (grid/sweep)
                                                          13  mlflow.sklearn.autolog
                                                          14  signature + input_example
                                                          15  pyfunc + custom Conda env
                                                          16  load_model + mlflow.evaluate
                                                          17  Model Registry (MlflowClient)
                                                          18  MLflow CLI (admin & ops)
```

Chapters 6 → 18 form the **core MLflow track**. Each one is a 30 – 60 min hands-on lab.

## 6. Common runtime — ports, URLs, containers

After `docker compose up`, every chapter from 06 onward exposes the same endpoints:

| Service | Container name | Host URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| MLflow tracking + registry | `mlflow` | http://localhost:5000 | Experiments, runs, models UI |
| FastAPI | `fastapi` | http://localhost:8000 | Programmatic endpoints (`/train`, `/predict`, …) |
| FastAPI Swagger UI | `fastapi` | http://localhost:8000/docs | Try endpoints from the browser |
| Streamlit | `streamlit` | http://localhost:8501 | Friendly UI to drive FastAPI |
| MLflow CLI (chap 18 only) | `mlflow-cli` | *(no port)* | `docker compose exec cli bash` |

Inside the Docker network, services talk to each other by name (DNS):

```text
streamlit  ──►  http://fastapi:8000     (env var API_URL)
fastapi    ──►  http://mlflow:5000      (env var MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI)
```

Persistent state lives in two named volumes (kept across `docker compose down`, wiped only with `down -v`):

| Volume | What it stores |
|---|---|
| `mlflow-db` | The SQLite metadata DB (experiments, runs, registered models) |
| `mlflow-artifacts` | All artifacts: pickled models, signatures, plots, CSVs |

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

<a id="section-7"></a>

## 7. Cheat sheet — Docker Compose

The minimum you'll use 95 % of the time:

| Goal | Command |
|---|---|
| Build & start (foreground, see logs) | `docker compose up --build` |
| Build & start (detached) | `docker compose up -d --build` |
| Tail logs of one service | `docker compose logs -f fastapi` |
| Open a shell in a service | `docker compose exec fastapi bash` |
| Restart one service | `docker compose restart fastapi` |
| Stop, keep volumes (state preserved) | `docker compose down` |
| Stop, wipe volumes (clean slate) | `docker compose down -v` |
| Free disk space across all chapters | `docker system prune -a --volumes` |
| List running containers | `docker compose ps` |
| Inspect ports already bound | `docker compose port fastapi 8000` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always `docker compose down` **before** changing chapter — otherwise the next chapter cannot bind ports 5000 / 8000 / 8501.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

<a id="section-8"></a>

## 8. Folder layout reference

Every `chapXX-.../` folder is structurally identical:

```text
chapXX-<descriptive-name>/
├── README.md                 ← local quick-start for THIS chapter
├── docker-compose.yml        ← 3 services (4 in chap 18)
├── mlflow/
│   └── Dockerfile            ← MLflow server image (sqlite + local artifacts)
├── fastapi/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── requirements.txt      ← changes only when a new lib is needed
│   └── app/
│       ├── main.py           ← THE file that demonstrates today's concept
│       └── (wrapper.py)      ← only from chap 15 onward
└── streamlit/
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── app/
        └── app.py            ← UI to call the FastAPI endpoints
```

So when comparing two chapters, focus on:

1. `fastapi/app/main.py` — 90 % of the diff.
2. `streamlit/app/app.py` — UI follow-up.
3. `fastapi/requirements.txt` — sometimes a new dependency.
4. `docker-compose.yml` — almost never changes (chap 18 is the exception: it adds a `cli` service).

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5000 failed: port is already allocated` | Previous chapter still running. | `docker compose down` in the **previous** chapter folder. |
| MLflow UI on :5000 returns 502 / hangs | The healthcheck hasn't passed yet. | Wait 10 – 20 s. Or `docker compose logs -f mlflow`. |
| FastAPI logs `ConnectionRefusedError` to `mlflow:5000` | FastAPI booted before MLflow was healthy. | Already mitigated by `depends_on: condition: service_healthy`. If it persists: `docker compose restart fastapi`. |
| Streamlit shows `ConnectionError to http://fastapi:8000` | FastAPI crashed. | `docker compose logs -f fastapi`. Most often a Python error in your `main.py` edit. |
| Nothing changes after editing `main.py` | Image was cached. | `docker compose up --build` (rebuilds), or use a bind mount + `--reload`. |
| `mlflow.evaluate` (chap 16) errors about `shap` | Optional dep not installed. | Either ignore, or `pip install shap` in the FastAPI image. |
| `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model("models:/.../Production")` returns 404 (chap 17) | No version is in stage `Production` yet. | `POST /promote` with `stage: "Production"` first. |
| Can't reach `http://localhost:5001` from the chap 18 served model | The `cli` service in `docker-compose.yml` doesn't publish port 5001 by default. | Add `ports: ["5001:5001"]` to the `cli` service and `docker compose up -d cli`. |

## 10. Suggested learning paths

### 10.1 The full course (recommended)

Read in order: 01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → **06 → 18**, one chapter per session.

### 10.2 Express path — "I just want to ship a model"

If you already know what tracking is and only need the productionization story:

```text
06   Stack on Docker
14   Signature + input_example          ← the model becomes deployable
15   pyfunc + Conda env                 ← wrap business rules
17   Model Registry                     ← stable models:/X/Production URI
18   CLI — mlflow models serve          ← serve it in one command
```

### 10.3 Tracking-only path — "I'm a data scientist, I just want clean experiments"

```text
06   Stack on Docker
07   set_experiment
08   start_run / last_active_run
09   log_param + log_metric
11   set_tag
12   loops & sweeps
13   autolog
```

### 10.4 If you have one weekend

```text
Saturday morning: 01 → 02 → 06
Saturday afternoon: 07 → 09
Sunday morning: 10, 11, 13
Sunday afternoon: 14, 15, 17
```

You'll come out with a runnable, production-shaped MLflow workflow.
